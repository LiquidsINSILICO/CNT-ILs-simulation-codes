# CNT-ILs-simulation-codes

This repository contains codes, input files, and tutorials for studying the dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in ionic liquids (ILs).   
The workflow includes enhanced sampling simulations, quantum chemical calculations, and non-bonded interaction analysis.

The structure of this repository is as :

## Parameter Files

This directory will comprise force field files along with simulation file parameters.

## Codes Used For the Analysis

Sample code for analysis performed. Written mainly in Fortran.

## Gaussian Calculation setup and analysis

This will include the files from the Gaussian calculation setup along with little discussion about the files and resources.
Multiwfn Software tutorial will also be included for the help.
